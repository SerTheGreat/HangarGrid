# HangarGrid
A plugin for Kerbal Space Program that adds a visual grid to hangars

**Description**
Have you ever been annoyed by ending up with misaligned engines or clubfooted landing gear after spending half-an-hour
trying just to guess where to rotate to get them right?
This mod adds grid to SPH and VAB and "laser" guides for an active part to clearly you see where things are wrong. Simple as it is.

**Installation**
Extract contents of the released archive into your KSP/GameData folder.

**Usage**
While in SPH or VAB press the button to enable the grid. Once there's a root part you'll see the grid with origin bound to the part.
If you try to add or edit another one you'll see the red "laser" guides representing all three axis for it and all of its symmetry
counterparts. Now you have all the planes and axis visualized and it's the matter of several clicks to align the things.

It's time for some serious rocket engineering.

**Planned features**
* A GUI for grid customization that let's you change the look and declutter the view abit.
* Ability to bind the origin of the grid to any part instead of just the root part by a mouse click.
